The data pulled from the Pupilometer does not include CRF information recorded by the tester and stored in the SAS dataset.For Pupil Light Reflex (PLR) trials:	Whether it was a good or bad scan.	For Digit Span (DS) trials:	Trial Number	Digits Presented	Number of digits the subject got correct	Whether the subject passed or failed the trial.	Whether it was a good or bad scan.	To run, paste the DSmacros and PLRmacros code into two Excel Modules.  The current available subroutines are:ImportSASIntoPupilPLR()ImportSASIntoPupilDS()	User prompted to choose a txt file containing the SAS data, and an Excel file containing the Pupilometry PLR/DS data. For each row of the Excel file, it searches for a matching record in the SAS dataset, using Subject Number and timestamp as unique identifier. If a match is found, it will populate the SAS data into Excel.  If no match is found, it will populate an error message.		CleanPLRData()	Goes through the Excel data, and removes column if either the good/bad or Profile Normal aren't set as 1.  If a subject has no good trials and is removed completely, record it in the LostSubjectRecord.txt.RemoveColumns_PLR()RemoveColumns_DS()	Removes unecessary columns from the dataset. 	AveragePLRData()	Once the data has had bad trials removed, average the remaining trials into a single row to allow for merging into the SAS dataset.  Creates column indicating how many trials were inluded in the average.AverageTimeToTheSecond()	For the DS dataset only, takes a second's worth of waveform data, averages it, and creates a column header.CalculateDS_PCA()	Calculates the Peak Constriction Amplitude, based on trial length.TODO: 1) Write CleanDSData(), AverageDSData().2) There is currently a lot of duplicated code that should get consolidated.3) Depending on VETSA's needs, string subroutines together, instead of requiring the user to run them all individually.4) If 3, add code to saveas output at each stage (e.g. PLR_SASimported, PLR_BadTrialsRemoved, PLR_Averaged, etc.).5) Combine scripts so that it runs on both the PLR and DS datasets, instead of individually.6) Create user-friendly UI7) Recode into an executable, instead of a macro script?
